# Predict the Price Of Diamond
This project in gemology aims to accurately predict the prices of diamonds by taking into account factors such as carat weight, cut, colour, and clarity. The project has developed a powerful predictive model that comprehensively analyzes various characteristics of diamonds, and has achieved an impressive R^2 value (0.98). 

By successfully addressing the intricacies involved in diamond pricing, this project showcases an accurate predictive model that can be used to estimate diamond values with high precision!
